## Real-Time Object Detection and Depth Estimation with Flask
# Overview
This project combines real-time object detection and depth estimation into a single application using Flask. The system is designed to detect objects in a video stream and estimate their depth in real-time. This can be useful for applications such as robotics, Indoor object detection, augmented reality, and autonomous vehicles.

# Features
Real-Time Object Detection: Utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model  YOLO8s to detect objects in a video stream.

Depth Estimation: Estimates the depth of detected objects using stereo vision or a monocular depth estimation model.

Flask Web Interface: Provides a web-based interface to visualize the real-time object detection and depth estimation.

Easy to Use: Simple setup and deployment process.

# Requirements
